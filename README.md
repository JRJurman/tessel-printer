# Tessel Printer

https://youtu.be/84utpGbwJKU

Note, this project depends on some code which is not yet exposed in
ticket-printer. For this reason, a snapshot test version of the library is
exposed in the root directory. Running `npm install` should pull the other 
packages into the node_modules folder, and move the `ticket-printer` directory
in with the rest of the packages.

## Before you start
Make sure that you have gone through the tessel beginners guide, have the device
connected to your router, and that you have the cli installed. The `t2` command
in `npm start` requires that that is functioning. Once you have successfully
pushed code to it, you can start this project.

## To Run
```
npm install
npm start
```
