# Tessel Printer

https://youtu.be/84utpGbwJKU

Note, this project depends on some code which is not yet exposed in
ticket-printer. For this reason, a snapshot test version of the library is
exposed in the root directory. Running `npm install` should pull the other 
packages into the node_modules folder, and move the `ticket-printer` directory
in with the rest of the packages.

## To Run
```
npm install
npm start
```
